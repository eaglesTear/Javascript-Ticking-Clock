# Javascript-Ticking-Clock
A working, ticking clock with a visually pleasing CSS design scheme. Adapted from Web Dev Simplified.

I saw the idea for this on a YouTube Channel called Web Dev Simplified, but have decided to add my interpretation on the clock.

This involved the complete changing of the design scheme and the addition of the second markers on the clock, which I thought added a nice, more realistic touch to it.
